# GIC-modelling
-  model of geoelectric field using one-minute geomagnetic measurements from Intermagnet database.
- model is applied to the long-term measurements of the geomagnetic field during the period of increased solar activity (for example in days when aurora was observed) and considered possible destructive effects on the distribution network infrastructures. 
- using geoelectric field currents that are induced in these infrastructures are computed
